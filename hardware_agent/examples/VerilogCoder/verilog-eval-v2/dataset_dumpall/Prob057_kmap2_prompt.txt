I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  c
 - input  d
 - output out

The module should implement the circuit described by the Karnaugh map
below.

              a,b
   c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
   0,0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
   0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   1,1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   1,0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
