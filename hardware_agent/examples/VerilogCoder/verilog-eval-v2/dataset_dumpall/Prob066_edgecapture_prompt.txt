I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in    (32 bits)
 - output out   (32 bits)

The module should examine each bit in the 32-bit input vector, and
capture when the in (32 bits) changes from 1 in one clock cycle to 0 the
next. "Capture" means that the out (32 bits) will remain 1 until out 
is reset (active high synchronous reset). The in (32 bits) need to be 
stored for next capture when the reset is active. Assume all sequential 
logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
