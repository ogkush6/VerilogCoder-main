I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  y (6 bits)
 - input  w
 - output Y1
 - output Y3

Consider the state machine shown below:

  A () --0--> B
  A () --1--> A
  B () --0--> C
  B () --1--> D
  C () --0--> E
  C () --1--> D
  D () --0--> F
  D () --1--> A
  E () --0--> E
  E () --1--> D
  F () --0--> C
  F () --1--> D

Resets into state A. For this part, assume that a one-hot code is used
with the state assignment y[5:0] = 000001, 000010, 000100, 001000,
010000, 100000 for states A, B,..., F, respectively.
Here,the y[5:0] could can be a combinations of multiple states above.
The implemented module is expected to response the state bit.
For example, when y[5:0] = 6'b000110, y[2] == 1, y[1] == 1, the states include B, and C states.

The module should implement the next-state signals Y1 and Y3 corresponding to 
signals at y[1] (i.e., B) and y[3] (i.e., D). 
For example, Y1 is 1 when the next-state of y[3] will become 1.
Derive the logic equations by inspection assuming the one-hot encoding.
