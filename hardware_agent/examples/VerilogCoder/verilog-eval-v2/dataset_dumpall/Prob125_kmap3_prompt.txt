I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  c
 - input  d
 - output out

The module should implement the Karnaugh map below. d is don't-care.
The output out is 1'bx for don't-care case.

              a,b
   c,d  0,1 0,0 1,0 1,1
   0,0 | d | 0 | 1 | 1 |
   0,1 | 0 | 0 | d | d |
   1,1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   1,0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
