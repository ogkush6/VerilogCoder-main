I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (32 bits)

A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement where a bit position with a "tap" is XORed
with the LSB output bit (q[0]) to produce its next value, while bit positions
without a tap shift right. 

The module should implement a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 
32, 22, 2, and 1, respectively. Each bit position with taps (i.e., 32, 22, 2, and 1) 
produces their next value by XORed with q[0] except the tap position at the MSB 
bit position (i.e., 32) is wrapping right shift (i.e., q[0]) XORed with 1'b0.
Reset should be active high synchronous, and should reset the output q to 32'h1. 
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
