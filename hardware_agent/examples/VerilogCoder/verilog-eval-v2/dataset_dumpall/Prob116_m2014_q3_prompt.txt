I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  x (4 bits)
 - output f

The module should implement the function f shown in the Karnaugh map
below. d is don't-care. The output f is 1'bx for don't-care case.
x[3:0] is 4-bits input that consists of {x[3], x[2], x[1], x[0]}.

[Karnaugh map]:
                 x[1],x[0]
 x[3],x[2]  0,0  0,1  1,1  1,0 
    0,0   |  d |  d |  d |  0 |
    0,1   |  1 |  d |  0 |  1 |
    1,1   |  1 |  d |  d |  1 |
    1,0   |  0 |  0 |  1 |  d |
