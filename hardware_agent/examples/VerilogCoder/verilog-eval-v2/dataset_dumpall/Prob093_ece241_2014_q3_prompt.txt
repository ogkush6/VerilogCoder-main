I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  c
 - input  d
 - output mux_in (4 bits)

For the following Karnaugh map, give the circuit implementation using one
4-to-1 multiplexer and as many 2-to-1 multiplexers as required, but using
as few as possible. You are not allowed to use any other logic gate and
you must use a and b as the multiplexer selector inputs, as shown on
the 4-to-1 multiplexer below.

[Karnaugh Map]
             a,b      
  c,d  0,0 0,1 1,1 1,0
  0,0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  0,1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  1,1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  1,0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

Consider a block diagram with inputs 'c' and 'd' going into a module
called "TopModule". This "TopModule" has four outputs, mux_in[3:0], that
connect to a four input mux. The mux takes as input {a,b}. 
Output mux_in[0] is with {a,b} = {0,0}, mux_in[1] 
is with {a,b} = {0,1}, mux_in[2] is with {a,b} = {1,0}, 
and mux_in[3] is with {a,b} = {1,1}. 

You are implementing in Verilog just the portion labelled "TopModule", such 
that the entire circuit (including the 4-to-1 mux) implements the K-map.
